# Java Learning Repository

This project is my learning repository for Java programming, containing various tutorials and projects ranging from basic console applications to advanced 3D graphics.

## Projects Overview

### tut1.java - Hello World
Basic Java program demonstrating simple output.

### tut2.java - User Input Program
Program that takes user input and displays personalized messages.

### tut3.java - Number Comparison
Program that compares two numbers and finds the smaller one.

### tut4.java - Console Person Management
Console-based person management system with array handling, data storage, and search functionality.

### tut5.java - GUI Person Management System
**GUI (Graphical User Interface)** version of the person management system using Java Swing.

#### What is GUI?
GUI stands for **Graphical User Interface** - a visual way for users to interact with programs using buttons, forms, tables, and windows instead of text commands.

#### How tut5.java Works:
- **Frontend Design**: Uses Java Swing components (JFrame, JTable, JButton, JDialog)
- **Data Management**: Stores person data with ID, name, salary, and occupation
- **Interactive Features**: 
  - Add new people through popup forms
  - Search by ID with instant results
  - View all data in a professional table
  - Clear all data with confirmation
- **Styling**: Color-coded buttons, formatted layouts, and user-friendly design

#### Key Components:
- **PersonGUI Class**: Data model for storing person information
- **Main Window**: Table view with search functionality
- **Dialog Forms**: Popup windows for adding new entries
- **Event Handling**: Button clicks and user interactions

### tut6.java - Predator Game
A 2D game featuring a predator-prey simulation with:
- Random movement patterns

## Running the Programs

All programs can be executed using the `runj.bat` script:
```bash
.\runj.bat tutX
```
Replace X with the tutorial number you want to run (1-10).

## Development Tools
- Visual Studio Code with Red Hat Java Extension
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Git for version control
