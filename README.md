#### What is GUI?
GUI stands for **Graphical User Interface** - a visual way for users to interact with programs using buttons, forms, tables, and windows instead of text commands.

#### How tut5.java Works:
- **Frontend Design**: Uses Java Swing components (JFrame, JTable, JButton, JDialog)
- **Data Management**: Stores person data with ID, name, salary, and occupation
- **Interactive Features**: 
  - Add new people through popup forms
  - Search by ID with instant results
  - View all data in a professional table
  - Clear all data with confirmation
- **Styling**: Color-coded buttons, formatted layouts, and user-friendly design

#### Key Components:
- **PersonGUI Class**: Data model for storing person information
- **Main Window**: Table view with search functionality
- **Dialog Forms**: Popup windows for adding new entries
- **Event Handling**: Button clicks and user interactions

### tut6.java - Predator Game
